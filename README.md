# Speedy Gym


## First Milestone. User Centric Frontend Development. Code Institute.
This is a website that promote an imaginary gym. The website includes a description of the gym, membership prices, timetable for all the classes, a contact page and a gallery page.

## Demo
A live demo con be found here at github:  https://marcomoreschi.github.io/marco-milestone/

## UX
My intent with this website is to make it simple to use and understand for any customers. I want to give the clear vision of the activity and services which they can find in the gym.
For the gym owner the website will increase his business, create word of mouth and attract more customer.

### Design Choices

The overall feel of the site is one that is designed for users to find out about the gym, classes and facilities in an easy to understand way. The following design choices were made with this in mind:

**Fonts**

- The primary font **Exo** was chosen because it is a clean, easy to read sans-serif font giving a modern look to the site.


**Icons**

- The social media link iconsand other icons (on contact page) were chosen for their obvious meaning and purpose so that they can be understood by all users. I used the iconfont [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/).

**Colours**

- The primary colour choices of dark and light blue for the logo. Black text on a white background was selected for both titles and body text so they have a clean clear aspect, while using bold on titles created contrast.
- The menu hover colour was selected to match the yellow in the logo.
- The call-to-action buttons were made blue to create a standout contrast making them more noticeable.

**Styling**

- Form inputs and buttons were given rounded corner, keeping consistency in design and maintains the feeling that all elements belong together.

**Images**

- The hero image on home page was chosen because the barbell is one of the main equipment used for exercise and in weight lifting
- The gallery images are arranged in a masonry-style format to allow missing both portrait and landscape orientations.  The gallery page employs a simple lightbox powered by minimal javascript.
